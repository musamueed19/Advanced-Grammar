## Project Introduction

- When browsing the "Xuan Yuanyou Advanced Grammar" [Online Project] (https://grammar.codeyu.com/) produced by [codeyu](https://github.com/codeyu), I noticed that the page layout may appear in some cases not very coordinated, and the content is mainly concentrated on the left half of the screen.At the same time, I found that there is [many user feedback] in the issues list (https://github.com/codeyu/EnglishGrammarBook/issues?q=%E5%A4%A7%E9%99%86), hoping to have a version that is more in line with the user's reading habits in Simplified.

- Inspired by this project, I made [First Edition] (https://xuangrammar.vercel.app/) based on my personal style preferences, and adjusted the typesetting and verbal habits in the original project, converting many words from Taiwan into expressions that are more in line with the habits of the mainland. At the same time, I also standardized the problem of mixing punctuation in Chinese and English.

- This project is built using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

- If you encounter any errors or problems, please feel free to submit them in the [issues](https://github.com/musamueed19/advanced-grammar/issues/) area.

- Advanced Grammar in the Context of Xuan Yuanyou
Xuan Yuanyou, a distinguished figure in the study of linguistics, particularly emphasizes the importance of advanced grammar in language acquisition and usage. Advanced grammar goes beyond basic sentence structures and delves into the complexities of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
One key area of focus in advanced grammar is the use of complex sentence structures. This involves understanding clauses, phrases, and their functions within a sentence. For instance, subordinate clauses can add depth and detail, enhancing the clarity of communication.
Additionally, Xuan Yuanyou highlights the significance of grammatical nuances in expressing different meanings and emotions. The use of modality, for example, allows speakers to convey certainty, possibility, or necessity. This aspect of advanced grammar is crucial for effective discourse in both written and spoken forms.
Furthermore, advanced grammar encompasses the study of stylistic choices, such as the use of active versus passive voice, which can significantly impact the tone and impact of a message. Understanding these elements is essential for anyone aiming to master a language at a higher level.
In conclusion, Xuan Yuanyou's insights into advanced grammar not only illuminate the intricate structures of language but also underscore the importance of these structures in effective communication.
